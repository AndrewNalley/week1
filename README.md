# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

While the output of the webpage is functional for most users, the HTML had too many <div> elements. These make it difficult for impaired individuals to use the page, and they impede easy navigation for other developers. I replaced the <div> tags with more descriptive semantic elements. 

The CSS was functional, but with unnecessary repetition. I refactored the code to be more concise and readable. 

This excercise helped me understand that there is more than one way to create the same website, but putting some extra thought into the layout of the source code will make interactions much easier for future developers and impaired users.
